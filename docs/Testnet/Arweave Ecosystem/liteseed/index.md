 ## Test Phases

### Phase 1 (Now - May 28) 

Initially 50 slots are for people running the node (~10 are live). I am reaching out to people that filled the form giving them 24 hours to respond.  If they decide they aren't interested, I am moving on to the next group of people. So the role and tokens are being given on a rolling basis. Many people haven't responded so don't worry if you filled the form a bit later, you'll likely still get a chance.

### Phase 2 (June 1 - June 10)
100 slots

### Phase 3  (June 16 - June 30) 
500 slots 

### Phase 4 (July - Future) 
Public Beta
