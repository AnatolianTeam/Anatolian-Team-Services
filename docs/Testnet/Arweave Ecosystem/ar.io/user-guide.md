### Wallet
We need a wallet to perform our transactions in the Arweave ecosystem. You can install the Ar Connect wallet in your browser from [here](https://www.arconnect.io/).

:::warning
Don't forget to keep your wallet keywords in a place that only you can access.
:::

### Ar Token
You need Ar token to perform our transactions. You can obtain it from exchanges.

Before performing these transactions, let's calculate the cost.

:::warning
These transactions are not investment advice. You can decide whether to participate or not by doing your own research.
:::

The minimum expenses to be made are listed below.

1. To rent an ArNS domain name (**13 characters and above**) `1013 tARIO ~ $40.6` (January 6, 2024)
2. To delegate, at least `15+ tARIO ~ $0.55-1` (January 6, 2024)
3. If you want to run a gateway, the delegation amount required to join the network is `10K tARIO ~ $333` (January 6, 2024)

* If you are not going to run a gateway node, your cost will be `41` as of January 6, 2024. If you include the price changes and fees for other transactions, it will cost at least `55`.

### Bridge

To use our Ar tokens as wAR, we go to the https://aox.xyz/#/beta bridge. It may take up to half an hour for the tokens to pass.

### Get tARIO Tokens

After the bridge process, we purchase `tARIO` tokens at https://www.permaswap.network/#/ao/WAR-TARIO?tab=swap with the tokens we receive as wAR.

### ArNS Domain Lease

Since domain purchase is expensive, we use the rental method, i.e. `Lease` option.

What you need to do is go to [ArNS](https://arns.app/) and search for your domain name, select the appropriate name and continue the process with the `Lease` option.

What you need to do next:

1. **Setting Primary Name**: Go to the `Manage Assets` page and click the `star` icon in the row where your domain is located and set your domain as the Primary Domain.

2. On the `Manage Assets` page, click the `cogwheel` icon in the row where your domain is located and find the `Undernames:` line on the page that opens, you will see the `Manage` button there. Click on it and create at least 2 all domain names here.

### Using ArDrive

Go to https://app.ardrive.io/ and upload your desired files here. Check the Assign an ArNS name box in the window that opens during uploading and select a subdomain name in the window that opens. In this way, a jpeg, gif image or pdf file that you upload will be defined to this address.

* You can upload more than 50 GB of files here. The more you upload, the better.

### Delegation

Go to https://network-portal.app/gateways#/staking and connect your wallet. Then you can stake to the desired gateways in the list that opens. We recommend that you stake at least 15+ tARIO. If you want to stake to us and our friends as a team, the addresses are below:

* **Note:** You will make us happy if you choose people who do not have 11 delegates while staking. On the page you opened, you can see the number of delegates belonging to the gateway operator in the `Active Delegates` tab.
