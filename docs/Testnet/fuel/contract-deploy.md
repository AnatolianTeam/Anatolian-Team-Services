apt-get install curl git screen -y
```

## Installing the Rust

### Installing and Updating the Fuel Toolchain 
```shell
fuelup toolchain install latest
fuelup self update
fuelup update && fuelup default latest
```

## Creating the Contract

```shell
mkdir fuel-project && cd fuel-project
forc new counter-contract
```
### main.sw Dosyasƒ±nƒ± D√ºzenleme 
```shell
nano counter-contract/src/main.sw
```
Open the file and delete everything in it, then paste the codes below, save and exit with CTRL, X, Y and Enter.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Codes for main.sw file">

```
contract;

storage {
		counter: u64 = 0,
}

abi Counter {
		#[storage(read, write)]
		fn increment();

		#[storage(read)]
		fn count() -> u64;
}

impl Counter for Contract {
		#[storage(read)]
		fn count() -> u64 {
				storage.counter.read()
		}

#[storage(read, write)]
fn increment() {
    let incremented = storage.counter.read() + 1;
    storage.counter.write(incremented);
		}
}
EOF
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Preparing the Contract
```shell
cd counter-contract
forc build
```
