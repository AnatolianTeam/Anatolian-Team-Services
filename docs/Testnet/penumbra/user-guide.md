# Penumbra User Guide

## Prax Wallet

Before starting the process, install the Penumbra add-on wallet [Prax](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/prax-wallet/lkpmkhpnhknhmibgnmmhdhgdilepfghe) and create a wallet.

## Request Test Token

After joining the [Discord](https://discord.gg/AWshYAkKTb) server, send your wallet address to the `#ðŸš°-testnet-faucet` channel.

:::warning
You can request tokens from the faucet `every 6 hours`. The tap is restricted against heavy use. You can receive a maximum of `100 UM` tokens per day.

## Transactions

Transactions are made at https://app.testnet.penumbra.zone/. When you first connect your wallet here, your wallet will be synchronized. You need to wait for the bar shown in the picture below to be completely filled.
