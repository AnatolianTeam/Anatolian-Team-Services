## Creating a Penumbra Wallet

Utilizing the CLI, you'll initiate the wallet generation.
```
pcli init soft-kms generate
```

:::warning
As you go through the process, a private key (Private Seed) will be generated. It's crucial to safeguard this key diligently, as it serves as a lifeline in the unfortunate event of losing access to your wallet.
:::

To locate your wallet address, employ the subsequent command:
```
pcli view address
```

Should you need to import a wallet you've previously generated:
```
pcli init soft-kms import-phrase
```

Head over to the [Penumbra Discord](https://discord.gg/2Ez55n4txb) to redeem faucet tokens for the wallet you've generated.

Insert your wallet address into the #-testnet-faucet channel.

Check your wallet balance:
```
pcli view sync
pcli view balance
```
